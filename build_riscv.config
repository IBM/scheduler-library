# Should always enable this one...
CONFIG_ESP_INTERFACE=y

# This sets the maximum number of any Acceleartor type in this build
#  This should be equal to the largest number of any of CPU, FFT, VIT, etc.
#  But it could be a larger value as well
CONFIG_MAX_ACCEL_ANY_TYPE=3

# This selects the number of CPU Accelerators
CONFIG_NUM_CPU=3
# This selects the number of each Large-Version HWR Acceleartor by type
CONFIG_NUM_VIT=3
CONFIG_NUM_FFT=3


# This next set ONLY applies to setups that support the hardware acceleratos
#  This means a cross-compile to target the SoC/FPGA
CONFIG_FFT_EN=y
CONFIG_FFT_FX=32
CONFIG_FFT_BITREV=y

CONFIG_VITERBI_EN=y

# This allows compilation to an executable with LOTS of debugging messages enabled.
# CONFIG_VERBOSE is not set
# CONFIG_VERBOSE=y

# This allows compilation to an executable with T(only) hread-debugging messages enabled.
# CONFIG_DBG_THREADS=y

# This enables use of GDB, etc. (adds symbols to the compilation)
# CONFIG_GDB=y
